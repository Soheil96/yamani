                Ahmed claims to be Sayyed and uses that to assert being Yamaani and 1st Mahdi. His followers, known as Ansar al-Mahdi (/ænˈsɑːr ælˈmɑːhdi/) believe that Ahmed is Sayyed,
                and distribute a family tree for him referring to Imam Hojjat ibn al-Hasan (/ɪˈmɑːm hɔːˈdʒæt ɪbn ælˈhæsæn/), the 12th Imam of Shi'a muslims and going back to Imam Ali ibn-Abi Talib (peace be upon him).

                On the other hand, this photo is confirmed by other sects such as Black Banners who believe that
